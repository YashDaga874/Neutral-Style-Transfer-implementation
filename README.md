# Neutral-Style-Transfer-implementation
This is based on the research paper "A neural algorithm based on Artistic Style" by Leon A. Gatys,Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge

**wHAT IS THIS NST ALGORITHM ABOUT?**

So this algorithm takes an input image and another image whose artistic style we want to copy onto our input image.
Suppose here we use this as our input image, 
![city](https://github.com/YashDaga874/Neutral-Style-Transfer-implementation/assets/118438239/635a45b6-fa72-4485-8d68-034c2749bbd6)

and we want to copy the artistic style of Van Gouh's famous painting 'the starry night' onto our particular image.

![starry_night](https://github.com/YashDaga874/Neutral-Style-Transfer-implementation/assets/118438239/2389ea97-5112-4206-be91-77d6f26ef44a) 

What is the result we get? 

We get this beautiful style of the starry night implemented onto the city image.
